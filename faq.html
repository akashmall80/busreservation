            <h3>Q: Is it safer to travel by bus or by plane during COVID-19?</h3>
            <p>A: Though a flight might save some travel time as it does go from Point A to Point B a lot faster than a bus, it is advisable to travel by bus instead. If a passenger wishes to travel via airplane, they would have to get to the terminal early and wait for a long time before boarding a flight. There is a risk of infection as the air in the plane is circulated within the sealed tube and could pose a danger if an asymptomatic passenger does carry the virus onboard. With a bus, the passenger can wait in their vehicle before boarding the bus, and therefore, crowding at a boarding point is significantly reduced. Passengers can even keep their windows open to ensure that fresh air is circulated in the bus. Measures followed on Safety+ buses considerably minimize the chance of contracting the virus on a bus than an airplane.</p>
